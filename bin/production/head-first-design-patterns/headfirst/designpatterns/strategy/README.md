# Strategy Pattern
This is an exercise of strategy pattern.

# Point
The point is to divide behaviors from super class (`Duck.java`).  
`fly()` and `quack()` will be changed by external requirements without your expectation.  
It's impossible for the developer to control, depends on others.  
To easy to change source code for such unexpected requirements, extract a `changeable part` in design phase.
