# Decorator Pattern

This is an exercise of decorator pattern.

# Point

The point is use `Decorator` instead of creating `Sub-Class`.  
`Decorator` class is same type of the target class. So, `Decorator` can put additional behavior
before and after call components.  
You should take care of this pattern because it makes easy to increase the number of decorator
class. It may cause complex design.
