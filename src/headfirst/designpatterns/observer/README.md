# Observer Pattern

This is an exercise of observer pattern.

# Point

The point is to make `loosely-coupled design` for each object.
`Subject` only knows that `Observer` implements a specific interface (`Observer Interface`).
`Subject` can add and delete new `Observer` without any modification when never you want. You can
reuse both object and there are no effects even if you modify `Subject` or `Observer`.
